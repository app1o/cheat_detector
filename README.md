# Cheat Detector üßë‚Äçüíª

A lightweight GUI application that monitors running processes and detects specified applications from a blacklist. Perfect for educational environments, parental controls, or system monitoring.

## Features

- **Real-time Process Monitoring**: Continuously scans running processes every second
- **Customizable Blacklist**: Uses a CSV file to define which applications to detect
- **User-friendly GUI**: Clean interface built with CustomTkinter
- **Process Termination**: Ability to terminate detected processes
- **Live Logging**: Real-time display of detected applications


## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Required packages:
  ```
  psutil
  customtkinter
  tkinter (usually comes with Python)
  ```

## Installation

### Option 1: Ready-to-Use Executable (Recommended)

**üöÄ Quick Start**: A pre-built executable is available for immediate use!

1. Go to the `app` folder in this repository
2. Download the ZIP file containing the executable
3. Extract the ZIP file to your desired location
4. The executable comes with a sample `cheat.csv` file
5. Run the executable directly - no Python installation required!

### Option 2: Run from Source

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cheat-detector.git
   cd cheat-detector
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil customtkinter
   ```

3. Create a `cheat.csv` file in the same directory as the script with the application names you want to monitor (one per line):
   ```
   notepad.exe
   calculator.exe
   chrome.exe
   discord.exe
   ```

## Usage

### For Executable Version:
1. **Download**: Get the ZIP file from the `app` folder
2. **Extract**: Unzip to your preferred location
3. **Run**: Double-click the executable file
4. **Configure**: Edit the included `cheat.csv` file to customize your blacklist
5. **Start Monitoring**: Click the "Start" button to begin process monitoring

### For Source Code Version:
1. **Setup**: Ensure `cheat.csv` exists in the same directory as the script
2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python cheat_detector.py
   ```
3. **Start Monitoring**: Click the "Start" button to begin process monitoring
4. **Stop Monitoring**: Click the "Stop" button to pause monitoring
5. **Terminate Processes**: Click the "Terminate" button to close all detected applications

## Configuration

### cheat.csv Format

The `cheat.csv` file should contain one application name per line. Use the exact process name as it appears in the system:

```
notepad.exe
calc.exe
chrome.exe
firefox.exe
discord.exe
steam.exe
```

**Note**: Application names are case-sensitive and should match the exact process name.

## How It Works

1. The application reads the blacklist from `cheat.csv`
2. Every second, it scans all running processes using `psutil`
3. If any process matches the blacklist, it's logged in the interface
4. Users can terminate detected processes with the "Terminate" button

## Building Executable

To create a standalone executable:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed cheat_detector.py
```

Make sure to place `cheat.csv` in the same directory as the generated executable.

## Important Notes

- **Administrator Privileges**: Some processes may require administrator privileges to terminate
- **System Processes**: Be cautious when adding system processes to the blacklist
- **Performance**: The application scans processes every second, which may have minimal system impact
- **Security**: This tool is for monitoring purposes; ensure you have proper authorization before monitoring systems

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"cheat.csv not found" error**:
   - Ensure `cheat.csv` is in the same directory as the script
   - Check file permissions

2. **Cannot terminate processes**:
   - Run the application as administrator
   - Some system processes cannot be terminated

3. **Application not detecting processes**:
   - Verify process names in `cheat.csv` are exact matches
   - Check if processes are running under different user accounts

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
